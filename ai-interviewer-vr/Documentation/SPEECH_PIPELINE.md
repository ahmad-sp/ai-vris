# Speech Processing Pipeline

## Overview
The speech processing pipeline is a critical component of the AI interviewer VR application. It enables voice-based interaction between the user and the AI interviewer, facilitating a natural and immersive interview experience.

## Components

### 1. Speech Recognition
- **Class**: `SpeechRecognizer.cs`
- **Functionality**: Captures voice input from the user and converts it into text. This text is then processed to understand user responses and intentions.

### 2. Speech Synthesis
- **Class**: `SpeechSynthesizer.cs`
- **Functionality**: Converts text responses generated by the AI into speech. This allows the AI interviewer to communicate effectively with the user, providing a more engaging experience.

### 3. Sentiment Analysis
- **Class**: `SentimentAnalyzer.cs`
- **Functionality**: Analyzes the user's speech for emotional cues and sentiment. This analysis helps in tailoring the interview experience based on the user's emotional state, providing personalized feedback and adjusting the flow of the interview.

## Workflow
1. **User Interaction**: The user initiates interaction by speaking to the AI interviewer.
2. **Speech Recognition**: The `SpeechRecognizer` captures the audio input and converts it to text.
3. **Processing Input**: The text is analyzed for intent and sentiment using the `SentimentAnalyzer`.
4. **Generating Response**: Based on the processed input, the AI generates a response or question.
5. **Speech Synthesis**: The `SpeechSynthesizer` converts the AI's text response into speech, which is then played back to the user.
6. **Feedback Loop**: The process repeats, allowing for a dynamic and interactive interview experience.

## Conclusion
The speech processing pipeline is essential for creating a realistic and engaging interview scenario in the VR application. By integrating speech recognition, synthesis, and sentiment analysis, the application can provide a personalized and responsive interview experience.
